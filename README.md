**The features implemented here were already added to the [Rust version](https://github.com/lynn/pysearch), use that instead; it's faster and better.**

This is a modified version of [pysearch/old](https://github.com/lynn/pysearch/tree/main/old) by [lynn](https://github.com/lynn).

Try modifying the parameters at the top of the file, then `g++ -fopenmp -std=c++17 -O3 pysearch.cpp && ./a`.
